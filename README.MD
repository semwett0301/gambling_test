# ğŸ“Š Experiment Data Analyzer

## Overview
This project is designed to gather and analyze datasets from an experiment efficiently. It follows a structured architecture incorporating design patterns such as Observer and Strategy to ensure modularity and scalability.

## ğŸ“‚ Project Structure

```
ğŸ“¦ analyser
â”œâ”€â”€ ğŸ“‚ dto        # Common data transfer objects (DTOs) and interfaces
â”œâ”€â”€ ğŸ“‚ listeners  # Observer pattern listeners used in services
â”œâ”€â”€ ğŸ“‚ services   # Main logic and publisher classes
â”œâ”€â”€ ğŸ“‚ utils      # Helper functions and utility classes
â””â”€â”€ ğŸ“‚ readers    # Strategy pattern-based implementations for reading screenshots from different sources
```

### ğŸ”¹ `dto/`
Contains common interfaces and data transfer objects to facilitate communication between different components of the project.

### ğŸ”¹ `listeners/`
Implements the **Observer** pattern to handle event-driven interactions. Listeners in this directory react to events triggered by services.

### ğŸ”¹ `services/`
The core of the application. This directory contains **publishers** responsible for processing data and orchestrating the overall functionality of the system.

### ğŸ”¹ `utils/`
Includes various helper functions and utility classes that provide additional functionality to support the main processing logic.

### ğŸ”¹ `readers/`
Implements the **Strategy** pattern to enable flexible reading of screenshots from multiple sources. Each strategy provides a unique way to extract and process image-based data.

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.x
- Required dependencies (see `requirements.txt`)

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/analyser.git
   cd gambling_test
   ```

## ğŸ›  Design Patterns
- **Observer Pattern**: Used in `listeners/` to manage event-driven workflows.
- **Strategy Pattern**: Implemented in `readers/` to support flexible input processing.

## ğŸ›  Technology stack
- **Computer Vision**: library `cv2` and `pytesseract`
